11.1
Homework 1
- I noticed in the inspect code portion that I had a few redundancies.
- Javadoc
	- @param savedInstanceState was missing a tag description which was added.
	- Dangling Javadoc comment was fixed.
- Added basic documentation to the main activity.

- I did not make any changes to the homework as everything worked as I expected it to. 
Once I reformatted the code so that it looked pretty I left it alone.

Homework 2
- Added basic documentation to the main activity and listed params.
- Javadoc
	-Parameter name was expected. This was fixed.
	- @param savedInstanceState was missing a tag description which was added.
	- Dangling Javadoc comment was fixed.
- The homework is still broken. I could not get the app to connect to the database.

11.2
I created an issue with an enhancement tag. The visual verification for completed tasks has not been implemented yet.
Removing completed tasks without replacement isn't very user friendly in my opinion as I would like to see which tasks I have done and which I have not.
I think it would also help players make sure that their score is being tallied properly. I did not close this issue because it is a genuinely good idea
that we are going to implement in the future.

I like the issues tab in github. Nate and I talked about it and agreed that it would be nice to replace trello with it because having all of the information
in one site is better than keeping track of trello and github. If github ever gets issues and a live chat, slack and trello may be forgotten.
