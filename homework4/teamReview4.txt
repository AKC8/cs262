a.
Team Pilot has done a very good job with their user test. They gave instructions clearly and concisely. They clearly had rehearsed or were well informed on how their app worked.
The app had the same funtionality that it did during the mock presentations with tweaks here and there. I took the user test on Wednesday and by the time we reached the stakeholder
meeting they had implemented my suggestion to rename one of their tabs due to some confusion. They also managed to get google auth working which was very impressive.

b.
There was an appropriate amount of code in their client repo.
