Team E Stakeholder

a. The team has a varying amount of activity. I looked at it last week and it is similar to this weeks activity.
I don't think it is something to worry about.

b. Storylogs are excellent. They give a clear idea about what their goals are. There are a lot more of them now
so it may be difficult to get all of those into the final version. The class models and UI model on the other hand
are very confusing. A major issue I had is that they either seem redundant or the order in which they are loaded
in the UI diagram. Recent Challenges and Challenge Results seems like they could be combined to create a single page.
The Activity Selection and Activity of Challenge were confusingly worded. They seemed to do the same task as the board
for activities had not been created yet. Finally, I suggest adding a drop down menu of the sports or activities 
instead of an open field. This way users cannot write football and Football and have them count as separate entities.

c. The code I pulled I could not get to run. They should check to see if it works on multiple machines.\

d. The team's supplemental specification addresses all non-functional requirements I could think of. They seem to know
what they are doing.
