a. It looks like each person contributed to different parts of the project. It seems like an even split
in terms of amount of work. Earlier in the semester I was worried that only a few people would be working
but at the end it seemed like everyone contributed. Either by documenting, testing, coding, or running user tests,
all members of Team Pilot seemed to put in work.

b. I enjoyed their final presentation. In comparison to the earlier mock presentation, they streamlined the vision, app design,
and database diagram talk so that the demo could go longer. I liked that the demo was simplified. The drawer
menu was fixed so that the create challenge and issue challenge wording was no longer confusing.

c. Final application runs with some bugs. I could not get all of it to run with Android studio. I think that may be
a fault with Android studio and not on the actual application. When I have seen it in person, the app worked fine
without crashes.
